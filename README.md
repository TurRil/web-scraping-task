# web-scraping-task
The web scrapers made by the class for task 1 (those that submitted). 

For peer review, please mark the two people appearing immediately below your own name (e.g. Anri marks Ameerah and Blake). If your name is at the bottom of the list (Thomas, Vongani), wrap back up to the top of the list (e.g. Thomas marks Vongani and Anri; Vongani marks Anri and Ameerah). 

Remember the coarse and lenient marking: 1 for everything working and some "tutorial" flavour, 1/2 if decent but with issues, 0 if very poor or did not work at all.
